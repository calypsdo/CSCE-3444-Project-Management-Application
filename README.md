## Introduction

This is an Android Dev Studio/Kotlin based program that is a project management app for use on android-based cell phones. It utilizes Firebase for the database to store the necessary data structures

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run and edit this program, [Android Dev Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) is necessary.

While the Firebase database utilized for this project is still up (as of 10 AUG 2023), a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) account and database will be necessary to tie into the app.

### Running

To run this program, first start Android Dev Studio and clone this repo. Android Dev Studio will prompt you with a new project start from version control

In the URL box, add the HTTPS from the repo's code drop down for cloning

This will clone the necessary files. Once the project is loaded and up, build the current project by clicking "make project" under the "build" tab.

At the bottom of Android Dev Studio, you should be preseneted with a "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" output in the terminal

If the build was successful, then you will want to choose "app" in the top right and click the play/run button

You will then be presented with the load screen, followed by the login screen

If you do not have a login currently (within the database up, or your own), you will need to register one first.

See the following [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7EMl0Hg3bg) for the rest of the functionality and how to use the app.

## Issues

* Currently the app was written with deprecated methods and needs some updating (most likely with binding) to regain all of it's features.
